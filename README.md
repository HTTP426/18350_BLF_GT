# BLF GT 18350 Tube
The EDC option no-one wanted

Thanks to Dan Kirshner of http://dkprojects.net/ for the thread functions.

## Simplest build
- 1 x blf_gt_18350_tube_for_40mm_standoffs.stl tube
- 5 x 40mm long, 5mm outer diameter, M3 standoffs
- (optional) 9 x 6mm long, countersunk M3 screws

The standoffs in the 18650 cell carrier are stepped in at the ends, so the standard screws won't penetrate as far into 'normal' standoffs, but I found that they went far enough to hold the cell carrier together temporarily.

The 40mm spacers are shorter than ideal, so the 18350s will be tighter than I'd prefer. If you want a more relaxed fit, cut/grind/sand some 45mm spacers down to 43mm and use the blf_gt_18350_tube_for_43mm_standoffs.stl tube instead.

## Robust build
- 1 x blf_gt_18350_tube_for_43mm_standoffs.stl tube
- 5 x 46mm long, 5mm outer diameter, M3 standoffs, with the last 1.5mm of both ends turned down to a diameter of 3.9mm
